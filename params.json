It runs on x86 or ARM hardware. \r\nAll you need is a .NET runtime which can be Mono. I wrote this to run on my Raspberry Pi \r\nand sync to my NAS. It supports\r\n\r\n * Mirror Download (just download and mirror what's on the server)\r\n * Mirror Upload (just upload and mirror what's on the local machine)\r\n * Two way (keeps track of updates and deletions)\r\n\r\nSyncotron runs once and synchronises all files and then exits. It is _not_ a real-time\r\ndameon or service which runs continuously in the background.\r\n\r\nIn time it may run with .NET Core - but not today.\r\n\r\n## Install on Windows\r\nIf you just want to sync your personal files then you will be better off using the \r\nnative dropbox client which is much cleverer at identifying changes, more efficient\r\nand will be better supported. If, however, you want to sync with a secondary or multiple \r\nDropbox accounts, or just perform some selective syncing, syncotron might help.\r\n\r\nYou either need a recent version of the [.NET framework (4+)](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dn878908\\(v=vs.110\\).aspx)\r\nor [Mono](http://www.mono-project.com/download/).\r\n\r\nDownload syncotron here: https://github.com/sbs20/syncotron/releases/download/v1.0.6008.26780-alpha/syncotron_1.0.6008.26780.zip\r\n\r\nExtract the files to a directory of your choice and run\r\n\r\n## Install on Debian linux\r\n```\r\nsudo apt-get install mono-complete\r\nwget https://github.com/sbs20/syncotron/releases/download/v1.0.6008.26780-alpha/syncotron_1.0.6008.26780.zip\r\nsudo unzip ~/syncotron_1.0.6008.26780.zip -d ~/syncotron\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Options\r\n * Specify a LocalPath and RemotePath pair. The local path can be anywhere you have permissions\r\n   including a remote file share\r\n\r\n * Choose your hashing strategy. By default, Syncotron uses a hash of the size and last-\r\n   modified date for performance on slow systems, but it also supports slower MD5 content hashing.\r\n\r\n * Specify a CommandMode.\r\n    * AnalysisOnly - examines the files and doesn't do anything\r\n\t* Fullsync - always scans and compares all files\r\n\t* Autosync - scans and compares all files then subsequently scans and compares changes\r\n\t* Reset - clears local cursor information - Autosync will revert to a Fullscan once\r\n\t* CertifyStrict - if you've manually downloaded all files already and are confident that everything\r\n\t  is in sync, then by running certify you can avoid re-downloading / uploading everything so\r\n\t  that Autosync will work. Certify examines all files and takes a hash to store in its index.\r\n\t  Strict mode will fail unless all files are exactly present on both sides.\r\n\t* CertifyLiberal - as per strict, but only matches (same size) are certified. Everything else is\r\n\t  left so that the next sync job will do something about it.\r\n\t* Continue - sets the local and remote cursors so that subsequent Autosync will just apply changes\r\n\t  only. This is useful if you are not too bothered about having a full local index of files and you\r\n\t  are running in MirrorDown direction\r\n\r\n * ConflictStrategy\r\n    * None - do nothing (conflict remains)\r\n\t* RemoteWin - server always wins\r\n\t* LocalWin - local always wins\r\n\t* LatestWin - compares date modification stamps and uses the newest\r\n\t* KeepBoth - downloads, does a hash comparison, if different keeps both, otherwise resets hashes\r\n\r\n * Exclusions\r\n\t* An array of patterns to avoid. Useful for ignoring certain paths or files\r\n\r\n## Example command lines\r\n\r\n### Simple download example.\r\nSync up the remote /Documents directory. The first run will perform a full index and download.\r\nSubsequent runs will use a remote cursor to apply changes only\r\n```\r\nsyncotron.exe -LocalPath \\\\storage\\Dropbox\\Documents -RemotePath /Documents -CommandType Autosync -SyncDirection MirrorDown\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Full re-sync download\r\nIf you are concerned that Autosync has drifted out of alignment (perhaps through accidental \r\ndeletion of local files) then just run a one off Fullsync. If you don't have full control of\r\nyour local drive then this may be worth doing. It is slower than Autosync / Continue.\r\n```\r\nsyncotron.exe -LocalPath \\\\storage\\Dropbox\\Documents -RemotePath /Documents -CommandType Fullsync -SyncDirection MirrorDown\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Certify\r\nWhere local files exist and you know for certain that they are the same as the remote versions.\r\nYou want to avoid forcing a full download of all files again. Run a one off CertifyLiberal\r\nand then switch to Autosync. This works by building a full index of all remote and local files\r\nand their hashes so that subsequent changes can be easily spotted. Essentially this is *you*\r\ncertifying to the system that the remote hash and local hash can be associated.\r\n```\r\nsyncotron.exe -LocalPath \\\\storage\\Dropbox\\Documents -RemotePath /Documents -CommandType CertifyLiberal -SyncDirection MirrorDown\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Continue\r\nYou know all the local files are in sync (or don't care that they're not). And you just want\r\nto get straight to \"changes only\". The advantage of this approach is that it's a really fast\r\nshortcut. The downside is that if you need to switch to a Fullsync to ensure that everything\r\nis the same then Fullsync will not find local index entries (with file hashes) and will end\r\nup downloading a whole load of unnecessary data. If so - see Certify.\r\n```\r\nsyncotron.exe -LocalPath \\\\storage\\Dropbox\\Documents -RemotePath /Documents -CommandType Continue -SyncDirection MirrorDown\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Upload data\r\nSync up the local /Documents directory to remote. The first run will perform a full index and \r\nupload. Subsequent runs will rescan the local disk and compare it to previous runs to calculate\r\ndifferences to apply changes only\r\n```\r\nsyncotron.exe -LocalPath \\\\storage\\Documents -RemotePath /Documents -CommandType Autosync -SyncDirection MirrorUp\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Recover from \"Replicator already running\"\r\nIf a previous job has failed unexpectedly then it's possible that syncotron did not have a \r\nchance to clean up. If so add the -Recover switch.\r\n```\r\nsyncotron.exe -LocalPath c:\\Documents -RemotePath /Documents -CommandType Autosync -SyncDirection MirrorUp -Recover\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Two way sync\r\nThis is more like standard Dropbox. Syncotron tracks deletions so will delete remotely if\r\nneeded. Because of the way syncotron tracks deletions this can be quite slow if you are\r\nsyncing a lot of files and running on a slow computer. It takes around 10 minutes to do a \r\nfull scan of 100k files on a remote NAS running on a Raspberry PI 2. An i7 with a local SSD\r\nis considerably faster.\r\n```\r\nsyncotron.exe -LocalPath c:\\Documents -RemotePath /Documents -CommandType Autosync -SyncDirection TwoWay\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Running on Linux\r\nThis requires Mono to run. Furthermore, because of problems with Dropbox not being entirely\r\nconsistent with its reporting of file paths with respect to case, you MUST set the following\r\nenvironment variable MONO_IOMAP. You may also experience problems with SSL certificates if\r\nrunning on older versions of Mono (e.g. that on RPi) -- use -IgnoreCertificateErrors if you\r\nare comfortable doing so. Please note that _this is a security risk_. You can place the \r\nfollowing in a script file and mark it executable.\r\n\r\n```\r\n#!/bin/bash\r\nexport MONO_IOMAP=all\r\nmono ~/syncotron/syncotron.exe -LocalPath /mnt/storage/dropbox -RemotePath / -CommandType Autosync -SyncDirection MirrorDown -IgnoreCertificateErrors\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Exclude some files\r\nThis allows you to completely exclude types of files or whole folders. Exclusions are done using\r\na very simple pattern match at the start or end of the path _relative_ to the base pair. E.g. you\r\nare syncing /Audio with c:\\audio ... to exclude /Audio/Private/* or c:\\audio\\Private\\* then merely\r\nadd /Private. To exclude all \"desktop.ini\" files - add */desktop.ini. To exclude both delimit with\r\na colon:\r\n```\r\nsyncotron.exe -LocalPath c:\\audio -RemotePath /Audio -CommandType Autosync -SyncDirection MirrorDown -Exclusions=/Private:*/desktop.ini\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Known issues\r\n\r\n### System.InvalidOperationException: The underlying Task is already in one of the three final states: RanToCompletion, Faulted, or Canceled.\r\nThis only seems to happen when running under Mono - and on the Raspberry Pi. It happens outside\r\nof the runtime of syncotron and I believe it's this:\r\n\r\n * https://bugzilla.xamarin.com/show_bug.cgi?id=7965 which was fixed here\r\n   https://github.com/mono/mono/commit/94f551d4\r\n\r\nAlthough it was fixed a while ago, the fix hasn't got as far as the debian package on RPi. At\r\nleast, that's my working theory. Although it's annoying, syncrotron keeps track of what it has\r\nand hasn't done yet, so you can just re-run it with the same parameters.",
